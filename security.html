          <h1>Information security policy</h1>
          <p>This policy outlines Kuntoklubi’s approach to information security, detailing the guidelines we follow to protect personal data. It explains what data we collect, the reason for gathering it, how we securely store and safeguard this information, and under with circumstances we share it with third parties. Our commitment is to ensure that all data is handled responsibly and in compliance with relevant privacy regulations, protecting both our members and our business.  </p><br>
          <h3> Kuntoklubi gathers following information: </h3><br>
          <p>
            ○ Name, postal code and city, address, date of birth, and social security number<br>
            <span class="indent">○ Email and phone number </span><br>
            <span class="indent">○ Visit and usage history </span><br>
            <span class="indent">○ Billing information and history </span><br>
            <span class="indent">○ Extra information provided by customer for training customization </span><br>
            </p>
          <h4>Data storage period</h4>
          <p>When the membership ends, we will delete personal data within 6 months. However, if there are any outstanding invoices, we will retain the personal data until the invoices have been paid. All health-related information will be deleted immediately after the membership suspension has been successfully processed. Billing information will be deleted after 10 years.</p>
          <h5>Data Protection</h5>
          <p>We have implemented appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative security procedures to safeguard all data in our possession against loss, misuse and unauthorized access. For an example we regularly update software to ensure it complies with the latest security standards. We use encrypted payment systems to protect your financial transactions and we comply with PCI-DSS requirements. We have also installed secure access controls, such as key cards to prevent unauthorized entry to the gym facilities.</p>
          <h6>Sharing personal data </h6>
          <p>There might be need to share personal data in some situations. The data will be shared only in necessary situations and the handling of data is still very secure. Here are the reasons that we need to share your information.  
            We use other companies’ services, so we need to share information with them.  These services are payment services and IT-supported services. 
            There might be need to share information with the authorities, if there are some legal requirements or they request these information’s. 
            In addition to these, there are some optional services that need personal information.  However, these aren’t mandatory and accepting information sharing is always asked separately. These are analytics services, which are used to improve gym and service levels.  </p>
          <h6>Ensuring Information security </h6>
          <p>Our employers are well informed with information security. That’s because we have formed training events for them. In these events have been lecturers that are industry professionals. We have also online trainings that the employers must done. Confidentiality is base for everything, and that’s the reason why we approach information security with great precision. </p>
          <h6>Your privacy rights</h6>
          <p>You have different rights according to your privacy and data. These rights came from the GDPR.  
            You have right to ask information that are gathered from you, where that information is used and who has access to it.  
            You have right to ask correcting of any wrong or inaccurate information that is collected.  
            You can ask deleting of the information if it’s not needed anymore or if it’s used for different purpose than originally.  
            You have right to get your information transferred to the different organizations in shaped and machine-readable format. </p>
